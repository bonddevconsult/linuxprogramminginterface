# Chapter 1: A "Brief" History

## Definitions

- UNIX - a family of operating systems. There are, generally two definitions for UNIX in common use:

  1. Operating systems that have passed the official conformance tests for the "Single UNIX Specification" branded "UNIX" by **The Open Group**

  2. Operating systems that look and behave like *classical UNIX systems*(i.e., SystemV, Linux, and BSD)

- Linux - an operating system under th unix family of operating systems

## UNIX: A Brief history

### Intro

- Development was controlled by many groups both commercial and non-commercial
- Implementations diverged over time, leading to stadndardization

### Origins of UNIX system and the C programming language

- First implementation of unix developed in 1969, written in assempler for a Digital PDP-7 minicom
- UNIX is a pun on  MULTICS(Multiplexed information and computing service)
- UNIX Features inspired by MULTICS
  1. tree-structured filesystem
  2. The Shell
  3. Reading filestreams
- UNIX was rewritten in C in 1973
- C was created with the goal of eventually being used to implement the UNIX kernel
- C is small, efficient, powerful,terse, modular, pragmatic, and coherent when compared to contemporaries like FORTRAN and COBOL

### BSD and SystemV

- 1975/76 University of California Berkeley students and professors released the Berkeley Software Distribution(BSD) UNIX version
  - BSD added the following packages
    - csh - the C shell
    - vi - a text editor tool - [reference](https://manpages.org/vi)
    - BFFS - Berkeley Fast File System - [reference](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/FFS.pdf)
    - sendmail - a utility for sending emails - [reference](https://manpages.org/sendmail)
- January 1979 added the following packages:
  - awk - a utility to executy programs written in the `awk` programming language(specialized for manipulating text data) - [reference](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/awk.1p.html)
  - make - a utility to determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be [recompiled](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiling-a-c-program-behind-the-scenes/) and issue the commmands to recompile them - [reference](https://linux.die.net/man/1/make)
  - sed - utility to make text transformations on an input stream(like a file or a pipeline) - [reference](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sed)
  - tar - a program designed to store multiple files into a single file(aka an archive) and to manipulate such archives - [reference](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html)
  - uucp - a program to copy files between systems. - [reference](https://linux.die.net/man/1/uucp)
  - sh - the Bourne Shell
- 4.2 BSD - the basis  for SunOS - released in 1983. Included the following
  - A complete TCP/IP Implementation
  - The Socket API
- ATT's monopoly broke up and released a commercial UNIX implementation SystemV(five) in 1989, including many of the same features from BSD

## The GNU Project and the development of the linux Kernel

### The GNU Project

- 1984 Richard Stallman set out to create a "free" UNIX implementation and started the GNU Project
  - Free meaning the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.
  - Not related to free in terms of price
- GNU is a recursively defined acronym meaning **GNU's Not UNIX**
- In 1985 Stallman started the Free Software Foundation to support the development of "free" software
- The GNU project created the GNU General Public License which allows people to use their software  "freelly" as Stallman saw it
- Free software projects created by GNU
  - Emacs - a text editor [reference](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/emacs.html)
  - GCC - The GNU C Compiler Collection - [reference](https://gcc.gnu.org)
  - bash - the Bourne Again Shell - [reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
  - glibc - the GNU C library - [reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)
  - GNU HURD Microkernel - [reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/advantages.html)

### The Linux Kernel

- Version 1 released in March 1994
- Longterm release kernel today is on version 6
- They abandoned the weird versioning scheme after 2.6

### Linux Distributions

- Ubuntu, debian, rasbian, etc.

## Standardization

### C programming

- C89 is theversion mentionend in "The C programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie
- C99  was adopted in 1999 by ISO which added
  - long long data types
  - booleans
  - `//` style comments
  - restricted pointers
  - variable length arrays
- The most recent standard is C17

### Operating systems standards

- POSIX - meaning Portable Operating System Interface.
- POSIX.1 Became an IEEE standard in 1988
- Single UNIX Specification - SUS is another specification, generated by the X/Open Company
  - X/Open was an international consortium of computer vendors
  - It merged with the Open Software Foundation in 1996
- Eventually POSIX.1 merged with another standard SUSv4

##### More on POSIX.1

- An API standard for services that should be availble to a program by an operating system
- Based on the UNIX system call and C library function API
- Goes all the way up to POSIX.1j in the book
- Specifically POSIX Operating systems handle the following functionalities different from SystemV operating systems
  - Interprocess communication based semaphores
  - Interprocess communication based shared memory
  - Interprocess communication based message queues
  - Interprocess communcication allows programs to talk to each other without using the external network
